# Food Safety Checks for Consumers

Simple, globally applicable checks consumers can use before purchasing or consuming food products.

## 1. Check Expiry or Best-Before Dates
Do not purchase or consume food products that are expired or improperly labeled.

## 2. Inspect Packaging Integrity
Avoid products with broken seals, leaks, swelling, dents, rust, or tampering signs.

## 3. Storage Conditions
Observe whether products are stored according to recommended temperature and hygiene conditions.

## 4. Label Clarity
Ensure labels clearly show product name, ingredients, manufacturer or importer details, and batch or lot numbers.

## 5. Sensory Checks
Unusual smell, color, taste, or texture can indicate spoilage or contamination.
