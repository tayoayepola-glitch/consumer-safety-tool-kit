# Product Authenticity Guide for Consumers

This guide helps consumers identify authentic products and avoid counterfeit, substandard, or tampered goods across different markets and regions.

## Why Product Authenticity Matters
Counterfeit and fake products can:
- Pose serious health and safety risks
- Cause financial loss to consumers
- Damage trust in brands and supply chains
- Undermine public health and consumer protection efforts

## Common Signs of Fake or Substandard Products
- Poor print quality or spelling errors on labels
- Missing or altered batch/lot numbers
- Inconsistent logos, fonts, or packaging colors
- Unusual pricing that seems too good to be true
- Lack of manufacturer or importer contact details

## Simple Authenticity Checks Before You Buy
### 1. Examine the Packaging
Check for seal integrity, tampering signs, and overall packaging quality.

### 2. Verify Label Information
Authentic products usually include:
- Product name and brand
- Manufacturer or authorized distributor details
- Batch or lot number
- Expiry or best-before date (for food and consumables)

### 3. Use Verification Tools Where Available
Some brands provide:
- QR codes
- Scratch-and-verify codes
- Mobile or web-based authentication systems

Always follow official brand instructions when using these tools.

### 4. Buy from Trusted Sources
Purchase products from reputable retailers, pharmacies, supermarkets, or authorized distributors whenever possible.

### 5. Trust Your Instincts
If something looks, smells, or feels unusual compared to previous purchases, avoid using the product.

## What to Do If You Suspect a Fake Product
- Do not consume or use the product
- Keep the packaging and receipt if available
- Report to the retailer or brand owner
- Notify relevant consumer protection or regulatory authorities in your country

## Global Note
Product authentication methods and reporting channels differ by country. Consumers are encouraged to follow local regulatory guidance and official brand communication.
